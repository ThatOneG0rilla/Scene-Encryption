# Introduction
What This Does:
This is a tool that makes it harder for people using tools such as UABE or UABEA to edit properties of your scene. It does that by changing the default name of objects on your scene to random ones when you build your game, while ensuring to not scramble certain objects, to make sure that the scene stays intact and working.

Steps:
- Import Package
- Open settings (Tools - Scene Encryption)
- Change Ignore Layer to a new layer
- Make sure that objects that should not be encrypted have that layer
- Then you are done! You can change settings if you want but the default ones work just as well.
